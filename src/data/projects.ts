    fullDesc: "This project explores the intersection of aesthetic rawism and pure performance. By utilizing computational fluid dynamics (CFD), we developed a body form that minimizes drag while maintaining a brutalist visual language. The prototype features exposed carbon structures and integrated cooling ducts that function as both performance and aesthetic elements.",

    fullDesc: "The Cockpit Interface project focused on human-machine interaction in high-stress environments. We designed a custom operating system that prioritizes essential telemetry using a high-contrast monochromatic palette. The interface responds with zero perceived latency, ensuring the driver is always in sync with the vehicle's internal systems.",

By mapping the heat generated during extreme braking events, we created a visual language that represents energy dissipation. This project served as both a technical audit for brake cooling systems and a piece of generative digital art.",
